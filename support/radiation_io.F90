!  This file provides an interface to the provision of file units used
!  for logging (nulout and nulerr) and for reading data files
!  (nulrad), as well as an abort routine that should do clean-up
!  appropriate for the environment in which the radiation scheme is
!  embedded.
!
!  Rewrite this file as appropriate if the radiation scheme is to be
!  embedded into a model other than the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting
!  System.

module radiation_io

  ! In the IFS, nulout is equivalent to standard output but only
  ! output from the primary node will be logged, while nulerr is
  ! equivalent to standard error, and text sent to this unit from any
  ! node will be logged. Normally, nulerr should only be used before
  ! calling radiation_abort.

  implicit none

  ! This unit may be used for reading radiation configuration files,
  ! but should be closed as soon as the file is read. Note that we
  ! cannot read the value with the same name from
  ! ifs/module/yomlun.F90 since that module is compiled after this
  ! one. When the Fortran 2008 standard is more widely supported, the
  ! NEWUNIT feature of OPEN could be used instead
  integer :: nulrad = 25

contains

  ! Abort the program with optional error message. Normally you would
  ! log details of the error to nulerr before calling this subroutine.
